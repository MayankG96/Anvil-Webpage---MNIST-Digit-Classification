**Testing data Guidelines for successful image upload and visualization:**

1. CSV Format:
No header. The file should be UTF-8 encoded.

2. Structure:
The CSV must contain a 28x28 matrix, representing the pixel values of the image. Each row in the CSV represents one row of pixels in the image, with 28 values per row.

3. Pixel Values:
Ensure all pixel intensities are either standardized or within the 0-255 grayscale range. Standardized values will be automatically adjusted for visualization.

4. File Size:
The maximum upload size is 2MB.

5. Content:
The CSV should represent only one image, organized into 28 rows and 28 columns.
